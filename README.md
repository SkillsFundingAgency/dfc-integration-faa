List of dependencies in a table

|Item					| Purpose			|
|-----------------------|:------------------|
|Azure Function			| Its a Timer based trigger Function. The idea behind is to schedule for AV Feed fetch and insert in the CosmosDB and Sitefinity Repository
|Azure CosmosDB			| Its been used for AVFeed Audit Trail repository																							|
|Azure Storage			| Its been used for the Azure Storage queue , as the feed data is stored in the queue as the Json data|
|SiteFinity Repository	| Its used to map the soc code with the actual feed received from the AVFeed. The soc code is mapped and the data from the AV Feed is stored against the soc code					|
|Xunit-FakeItEasy		| Its and Unit Test Framework and Unit Test Mock Tool used for this project					|
|AutoFac				| Dependency Injection Tools used for this project					|
|AutoMapper				| Entity Model to DTo mapping tool used for this project					|
|AVFeed					| The Apprenticeship feed (External API based on OData used to receive feed for Sitefinity SocMapping					|


Running Locally

Then a section for each dependency, stating what someone would need to do to stand up the dependency, and then config settings which would need to be updated in the repo.



* ###  DFC.Integration.AVFeed.Function.GetAVForSoc.Console

* ###  DFC.Integration.AVFeed.Function.PublishVacancies.Console 

    This application push the data to the Sitefinity Repository for the Soc Code which is mapped , as the end result the Sitefinity displays the Mapped Apprenticeship Soc Data on the client (nationalcareersservice.gov.uk).
